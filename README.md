# Stupedia

Stupedia was an experimental project aimed at recreating the functionality of the controversial Peeple app, with an approach that was intended to be more mainstream and widely accepted. The core idea of Stupedia was to provide a platform for people to rate and review other individuals, similar to how Yelp operates for businesses.

## Screenshots

Here's a glimpse of what is was becoming:

## Motivation

The project was initially conceived as a way to explore the concept of reputation systems applied to individuals. The aim was to see how such a platform could be designed to balance transparency and accountability while minimizing potential misuse.

## Status

After receiving significant backlash and critical feedback about the ethical implications and potential for abuse of such a platform, development of Stupedia was halted. Only the initial front-end portion of the project was completed before the decision was made to discontinue work.

## Features Implemented

- **Front-End UI:** A basic user interface designed for listing individuals, displaying profiles, and collecting reviews.

## Lessons Learned

The feedback received highlighted important considerations around privacy, ethics, and the societal impact of such platforms. This project served as a valuable learning experience in understanding the broader implications of building technology that intersects with sensitive aspects of human interaction.

## Future

While Stupedia is no longer under development, the lessons learned from this project will inform future endeavors, particularly in creating technology that prioritizes ethical design and user well-being.
